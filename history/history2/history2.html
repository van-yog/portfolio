				<p>My name is Ivan. I am 30 years old and I really want connect my life with working with IT. I decided
					study JS, HTML, CSS, NODE.JS, because I want be Junior JS developer. I think it's sounds good. You
					can ask me about Middle JS developer or Sinior JS developer. Why I didn't say about this purpose?
					Because I have a son and I say to him "Junior". So it's sounds GOOD! </p>
